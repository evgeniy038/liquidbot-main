# The Liquid Collective - Discord Community

## Community Philosophy

This isn't a server for badges or titles. Roles here mean something. They're earned through trust, effort, and actually showing up.

**If you're here just for rewards, this isn't for you.**  
**If you're here because you believe in what we stand for, you'll fit right in.**

## Team Roles

The people behind Liquid:

### 🛡️ Staff
Liquid's core team. **They'll never DM you first. Ever.**

### 🔧 Moderator
Guides who keep things running smooth. If you need help, ping them—they've got you.

## How Roles Work

### Do NOT Ask for Roles

Please don't DM the team asking for roles. **That's not how it works here.**

Roles are given based on **trust and contribution**:
- Sometimes the community nominates you
- Sometimes the team notices
- Either way, it happens naturally

### Role Maintenance

**Inactive members may lose roles** so others have the chance to earn them.

### Still Building

Roles will evolve as the community grows. This is a living system, not set in stone.

## Summary

Liquid Collective is a community built on genuine participation, not handouts. Show up, contribute, and be part of something real.
