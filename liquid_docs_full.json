This strategy operates natively on the Hyperliquid exchange, where it benefits from privileged access to liquidation flow and order book data. This edge allows HLP to run sophisticated market-making algorithms that have historically delivered strong, consistent returns.\nThanks to this performance, the HLP Vault is currently offering yields around 10% APY, though rates may vary with market conditions.\n4-Day Lockup\nTo ensure system integrity and prevent abuse:\nEach deposit triggers a 4-day lockup period during which withdrawals are disabled.\nSubsequent deposits reset the cooldown, meaning the timer restarts from your most recent deposit.\nThis design helps maintain strategy stability and prevents spam on the backend.\nPrevious\nNews Trading\nNext\nReferral Bonuses\nLast updated 3 months ago",

(e.g. Robinhood, Coinbase) \nLiquid is non-custodial, meaning we never hold your funds or personal data. You trade directly from your own wallet, and your assets remain in your control at all times. This is fundamentally different from centralized exchanges like Robinhood or Coinbase, which take custody of your assets and personal information.\nKey Differences\nYou control your assets.\nWith Liquid, funds are stored in your wallet—not ours. There’s no single point of failure or risk of your funds being frozen, seized, or misused.\nNo KYC honeypots.\nCentralized exchanges store massive amounts of sensitive identity data (e.g. passports, selfies, SSNs). If that data is hacked—as has happened with platforms like Coinbase—you’re exposed. Liquid doesn’t require KYC to trade, so there’s nothing to leak.\nCensorship-resistant.\nOn Liquid, no one can freeze your account or block your trades. Everything is executed on-chain, permissionlessly.\nNo custodial blowups.\nWith a CEX, you’re trusting them not to go bankrupt, halt withdrawals, or run fractional reserves. With Liquid, there’s no trust required. \nPrevious\nTroubleshooting\nLast updated 3 months ago",
