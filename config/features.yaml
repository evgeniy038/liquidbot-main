        before we move on, here's something to know: this isn't a server for badges or titles. roles here mean something. they're earned through trust, effort and actually showing up.
        
        if you're here just for rewards, this isn't for you. if you're here because you believe in what we stand for, you'll fit right in.

        title: "⚠️ do not ask for roles"
        description: |
          please don't DM the team asking for roles, that's not how it works here.
          
          roles are given based on trust and contribution. sometimes the community nominates you, sometimes the team notices, either way, it happens naturally.
          
          inactive members may lose roles so others have the chance to earn them.
