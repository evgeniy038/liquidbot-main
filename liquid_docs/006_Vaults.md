Vaults
The highest-yielding, nearly risk free, source of income.
HLP Vault
The HLP Vault is a yield-bearing product that lets users earn high interest on their crypto deposits by participating in Hyperliquid’s native liquidity provisioning strategy.
How It Works
When you deposit into the HLP Vault, your funds are allocated to the Hyperliquid Liquidity Provider (HLP) strategy. This strategy operates natively on the Hyperliquid exchange, where it benefits from privileged access to liquidation flow and order book data. This edge allows HLP to run sophisticated market-making algorithms that have historically delivered strong, consistent returns.
Thanks to this performance, the HLP Vault is currently offering yields around 10% APY, though rates may vary with market conditions.
4-Day Lockup
To ensure system integrity and prevent abuse:
Each deposit triggers a 4-day lockup period during which withdrawals are disabled.
Subsequent deposits reset the cooldown, meaning the timer restarts from your most recent deposit.
This design helps maintain strategy stability and prevents spam on the backend.
