Liquid: The Ultimate Financial Super App.
Liquid Documentation
Who We Are
We’re a team of technologists, traders, and builders from places like Two Sigma, SIG, D.E. Shaw, and Amazon. Based in New York City, we’ve seen firsthand how archaic and inefficient the financial system is—from slow settlements and hidden fees to clunky user interfaces.
We believe finance should be open, fast, and user-first. That’s why we built Liquid: a modern financial super app powered by crypto rails.

Liquid is the easiest way to access the core building blocks of modern finance—all from your phone.
