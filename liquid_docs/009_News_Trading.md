News Trading
Liquid provides a gesture-heavy news feed you can trade from while scrolling. Each content card offers two different actions to tap into a new trade depending on your swiping and tapping preferences. 
While scrolling the feed, notice each card carries tallies of Bullish and Bearish votes. These are sourced from Liquid users who voted prior to you opening the newsfeed. If you agree, tap the Bullish or Bearish button to contribute your vote. If you want to express your bias as a trade, tap the Trade button that appears below the news card you voted on.
The app will redirect you to the order screen to enter the direction, amount, multiplier, and other details of your trade.
If you are reading the news feed but not considering votes by other users, simply swipe the news card to the left (bearish) or right (bullish) to express your bias.
To express your bias as a trade, tap the Trade button that appears below the news card you swiped.
